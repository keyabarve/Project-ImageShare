# Project-ImageShare

# Introduction
Helps post an image from your computer to Imgur and sends you back the link of the posted image via a text message.

Used the Imgur API to upload the image from your computer, using the path of the image. The program asks for the user's Imgur account information, to post the image on the user's account. The program outputs a link to the uploaded image.

Used Twilio's API to send a message containing the link to the image, to the phone number provided by the user.
